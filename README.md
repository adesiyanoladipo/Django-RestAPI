# Django-RestAPI
A simple functional Django-RestAPI website. This is quite basic but will help you while setting up yours too

# Installation
pip install djangorestframework

# Settings.py
Add 'rest_framework' to your list of apps, every other thing can be seen in the web app's seetings.py

#Disclaimer
This is the basic step that will also help you have your Rest API up and running in no time. Just like I did, I'd really advice you write function-based view codes too mainly as it is really flexible and you can eaily implement any thing of your choice into your view
